#Thoughts on User Interface

For the user interface, one challenge is to work out if squares are
contiguous.  

An algorithm I have been considering is to set up an object

Class block
   i % column index
   j % row end
   % other attributes such as setting the borders to be on or off.
end

Clearly you can tell if one block is adjacent to another by working out if
it is plus or minus i or j and has the same j or i.

To find out if a candidate set of blocks is contiguous you could do as follows

U = all candidate blocks
C = c1 1st block
S = U - c_1

While C ^= U

contiguous = true
If ci is adjacent to any of C
     S = S - c_i
     C = C + C_i
     k=1
else
     if k == length (U)
          congigous = false
          break
     end
     k = k + 1
     rotate S
end
