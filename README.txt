This is a repository of matlab functions to explore open source approached to solving KenKen puzzles.

At this point in time the program does an exhaustive search to find a 
solution to the KenKen puzzle. This works relatively quickly for puzzles up to 4x4 starts to take too long for puzzles large than this.
  
Further work could be to add heuristics to prune search, add a user interface, or convert from Matlab to another language.

All functions are provided under MIT licence, except for the ones written by Bruno Luong, which are provided under BSD licence.

Feel free to contribute or use this repository.
